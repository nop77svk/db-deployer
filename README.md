# Database deployer

Incremental DB deployments framework/tooling. If you don't know what an "incremental DB deployment" is, you may know it by the names of "database migration", "schema migration", or "database schema evolution".

Imagine something like Liquibase or GitOra, just **way way better** and easier to use.

Support for Oracle DB only, atm. There are plans for enhancing the portfolio of supported DBMS's in the future, but you know how things go with free time and family. :-)
